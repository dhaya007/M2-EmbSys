## SIMPLE EMBEDDED SYSTEM: Thermal Printer ##

A thermal printer is a printer that makes use of heat in order to produce the image on paper. Due to quality of print, speed, and technological advances it has become increasingly popular and is mostly used in airline, banking, entertainment, retail, grocery, and healthcare industries.
Thermal processes are noncatalytic processes that decompose, rearrange, or combine hydrocarbon molecules by the application of heat. When feedstocks are heated to temperatures over 350 °C (660 °F), the thermal or free radical reactions start to give way to cracking of the mixture at significant rates.

## COMPONENTS ##

1.	UART: The UART, or universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter, is one of the most used device-to-device communication protocols. In serial communication, data is transferred bit by bit using a single line or wire. In two-way communication, we use two wires for successful serial data transfer.

2.	LCD: LCD printer is a type of printer similar to a laser printer. Instead of using a laser to create an image on the drum, however, it shines a light through a liquid crystal panel. Individual pixels in the panel either let the light pass or block the light, thereby creating an image composed of dotson the drum.


## COMPLEX EMBEDDED SYSTEM: Digital Camera ##

A digital camera takes light and focuses it via the lens onto a sensor made out of silicon. It is made up of a grid of tiny photo sites that are sensitive to light. A hardware device that captures photographs and stores the images as data on a memory card. Instead of recording the images on film, they are recorded digitally. Once a picture has been taken, it can be downloaded to a computer system, manipulated with a graphics program, and printed.

## COMPONENTS ##

1.	JPEG CODE C: The JPEG standard specifies the codec, which defines how an image is compressed into a stream of bytes and decompressed back into an image, but not the file format used to contain that stream.

2.	CCD PROCESSOR: A CCD camera is a video camera that contains a charged-coupled device (CCD), which is a transistorized light sensor on an integrated circuit. In cameras, CCD enables them to take in visual information and convert it into an image or video.

3.	PIXEL COMPRESSOR: The proposed algorithm does compression of an image by reducing the size of pixel. 

4.	DMA CONTROLLER: Direct memory access (DMA) is the process of transferring data without the involvement of the processor itself.

5.	ANALOG AND DIGITAL: The process of converting a series of digital values into an analog counterpart is called a Digital to Analog conversion, typically abbreviated as D2A. Likewise the process of converting analog values into a digital representation is called an Analog to Digital conversion, or A2D.
